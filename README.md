# Frontend Mentor - Crowdfunding product page solution

This is my solution to the [Crowdfunding product page challenge on Frontend Mentor]

# The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked
